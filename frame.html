               An important part of the web that is unfortunately often forgotten is its historicity. On the surface, each page is present-day code. When a page is changed, it is changed forever, and its previous versions are lost to any day-to-day user. But digging deeper, it becomes apparent that many versions of sites are still available if you search long enough. Your metadata footprints exist on the web long after your session is complete.
